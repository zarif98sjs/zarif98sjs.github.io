The rise of MOOCs led to a very interesting research question - Given a large number of questions already posed by the students, how can we detect repetitive questions in real time and unify them as a single question for the instructor? Under the supervision of Prof. Subhra Kanti Karmakar, I worked on this problem of online short-text clustering. We developed a software tool called One Pass Sentence Embedding Clustering. This tool efficiently clusters short text streams using a unique one-pass algorithm that calculates similarity scores based on sentence embeddings. It was used as an internal tool to cluster questions in online classes at Auburn.\nCollaborators:\nMinh Smith (Auburn University) Ramisa Alam (BUET) Supervisors:\nDr. Shubhra Kanti Karmaker (Assistant Professor, Auburn University) Dr. Anindya Iqbal (Professor, BUET) 🏷️ Natural Language Processing Clustering 🔗 Project page Bangla Sign Language Recognition Oct. 2022 ‑ Feb. 2023 🟢 Sign language, as a different form of communication language, is important to large groups of people in society. Each sign in sign language is unique due to variations in hand form, motion profile, and positioning of the hand, face, and other body components. So, visual sign language recognition is a complex research area in computer vision. In this work, we present a new word-level Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) dataset consisting of 611 videos over 40 BdSL words, along with two different approaches: one with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network model and another a novel Graph Neural Network based approach for the classification of BdSL40 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on word-level BdSL recognition, and the dataset was transcribed from Indian Sign Language (ISL) using the Bangla Sign Language Dictionary (1997). The proposed GNN model achieved an F1 score of 89%. The study highlights the significant lexical and semantic similarity between BdSL, West Bengal Sign Language, and ISL, and the lack of word-level datasets for BdSLin the literature.\nSupervised 4 junior year undergraduates in this project!\nCollaborators:\nH.A.Z.

<p><strong>Sign language</strong>, as a different form of communication language, is important to large groups of people in society. Each sign in sign language is unique due to variations in hand form, motion profile, and positioning of the hand, face, and other body components. So, visual sign language recognition is a complex research area in computer vision. In this work, we present a new <strong>word-level Bangla Sign Language (BdSL)</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Patchwork53/BdSL40_Dataset_AI_for_Bangla_2.0_Honorable_Mention" target="_blank">dataset</a>
 consisting of 611 videos over 40 BdSL words, along with two different approaches: one with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network model and another a novel Graph Neural Network based approach for the classification of BdSL40 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the <strong>first study on word-level BdSL recognition</strong>, and the dataset was transcribed from Indian Sign Language (ISL) using the Bangla Sign Language Dictionary (1997). The proposed GNN model achieved an F1 score of 89%. The study highlights the significant lexical and semantic similarity between BdSL, West Bengal Sign Language, and ISL, and the lack of word-level datasets for BdSLin the literature.</p>
