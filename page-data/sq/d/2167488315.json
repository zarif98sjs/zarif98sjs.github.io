The research goal of this project is to use <em>computer vision techniques</em> to do this diagnosis remotely using a simple automated online screening tool.  In developing countries like Bangladesh, neurologists are scarce compared to the number of patients and a tool like this will enable people to get timely diagnosis and subsequent healthcare.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Occam's Razor Strikes Again: Revisiting Short-Text Stream Clustering with Latest Sentence Embeddings","tags":["Dr. Shubhra Kanti Karmaker (Auburn University)","Dr. Anindya Iqbal (BUET)"],"colabs":["Minh Smith (Auburn University)","Ramisa Alam (BUET)"],"range":"May 2021 ‑ May 2022","github":"","external":""},"html":"<p>We proposed a new method called <strong>One Pass Sentence Embedding Clustering (OPSEC)</strong> - an online one-pass algorithm that leverages similarity scores based on sentence embeddings to cluster short texts.
