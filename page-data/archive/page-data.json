This enhanced version achieves a speedup of <em><strong>20,000x</strong></em> compared to its predecessor and <em><strong>400x</strong></em> when compared with the widely utilized variant of QFM implemented in PAUP*. Furthermore, a comparative study was conducted on both simulated and actual biological datasets to evaluate the performance of QFM-FI with state-of-the-art methods. The study exhibited that QFM-FI outperforms QFM with regards to running time and tree quality while producing trees that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Worked on providing a theoretical analysis of the running time and memory requirements of QFM-FI.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Status : Accepted at <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bioinformatics (Oxford University Press)</a> Journal!</strong></em></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Paper</strong></a>] [<a href=\"https://github.com/sharmin-mim/qfm_java\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Code</strong></a>]</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-08-28","title":"Ray Tracing","tags":["Computer Graphics"],"github":"https://github.com/zarif98sjs/CSE-410-Computer-Graphics#ray-tracing","external":"https://github.com/zarif98sjs/CSE-410-Computer-Graphics#ray-tracing","company":null},"html":"<p><em><strong>Deep Dive into the 3D world with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">RTX-ON</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Implemented a ray tracing pipeline from scratch. <code class=\"language-text\">Phong Lighting Model</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Recursive Relfection</code> is used for proper lighting and ray tracting.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-08-27","title":"IntDesk","tags":["Full Stack Software Development","React","Django REST Framework","Docker"],"github":"https://github.com/zarif98sjs/IntDesk-frontend","external":"https://github.com/zarif98sjs/IntDesk-backend","company":null},"html":"<p><em><strong>A <a href=\"\">tech interview</a> preparation platform</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>IntDesk</strong> is an all-in-one tech interview preperation platform.
